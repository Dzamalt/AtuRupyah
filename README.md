# AturRupyah

AturRupyah is a web-based inventory management system designed to help small businesses manage products, sales, and stock levels efficiently using data-driven insights.

## Goal

Many UMKM (Usaha Mikro, Kecil, dan Menengah) in Indonesia still manage inventory manually using notebooks or spreadsheets. This often leads to:

- Inaccurate stock counts  
- Late restocking and lost sales  
- Difficulty tracking sales trends  
- No data-based planning for future demand  

AturRupyah solves these problems by automating inventory tracking and using past sales data to support better business decisions.

- Retail shops, kiosks, and small online sellers  
- Business owners who want simple, affordable inventory control  

## Features

- Track products and sales in real time  
- Automatically update stock after each transaction  
- Low-stock warnings to prevent running out of items  
- Predict future product demand based on historical sales data
